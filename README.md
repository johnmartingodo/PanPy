# PanPy
Boundary element method, or panel method, program written in python/cython. Currently in a very early stage of development. Main planned feature is simulation of lifting surfaces, both steady and unsteady. 

Current working features are steady state simulation of non-lifting surfaces using Newmann boundary conditions and steady state simulations of lifting surfaces using Dirichlet boundary conditions.
